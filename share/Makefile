#BOP
#!ROUTINE: share/Makefile - install, clean and distclean share
#!DESCRIPTION:
# This Makefile has three targets: install, clean and distclean
# The install target installs the share/Library/src,
# copies the OS and MPIVERSION dependent mpif90.h files into Library/src,
# copies the OS and COMPILER dependent Makefile from build to the parent directory.
# The OS, COMPILER and MPIVERSION variables should be set like in the following example:
#\begin{verbatim}
# make install OS=Linux COMPILER=ifort MPIVERSION=Altix
#\end{verbatim}
# The OS variable should always be set, the COMPILER and MPIVERSION are only needed if they
# are not the defaults.
#
# The clean and distclean targets do not need any variables.
